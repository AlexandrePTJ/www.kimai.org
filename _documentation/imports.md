## Importing from Kimai v1

There is a dedicated chapter about [migrating data from Kimai v1]({% link _documentation/migration-v1.md %}).

## Importing projects

This will import projects and create missing customers on the fly.

An empty team (with the projects name) can be created for each project, therefor the `teamlead` options needs to be set.
These teams will be assigned to the projects, but not to the customers. 

```bash
bin/console kimai:import:customer --teamlead=anna_admin --delimiter=";" --comment="" ~/Downloads/import-customers.csv
```

### All options

You can see all option by calling `bin/console kimai:import:customer --help` which will show:

```bash

## Importing timesheets

This will import timesheets and create on the fly:
- missing customer
- mising projects
- missing activities

Users have to be existing before (mainly because the users timezone setting is used to import the timesheets).

```bash
bin/console kimai:import:timesheet --timezone=UTC --activity=global --delimiter=";" --customer="Imported customer" ~/Downloads/import-timesheets.csv
```

### All options
