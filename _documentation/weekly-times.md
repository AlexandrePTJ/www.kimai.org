The "weekly times" view shows one week in a simple table structure, which mimics a classical spreadsheet.

Rows represent a customer/project and activity, where you can book one time for each date.
If you have multiple entries for the same day, there will be multiple rows for the same project/activity combination.

New users, without any previous timesheet, will see 3 empty rows.

Existing users will have up to 5 rows wit the last recent activities pre-filled.

If the existing rows are not sufficient, you can `+ Add` new ones at any time.

## Creating records

The start time of each new record is configured through `Default start-time` from [System > Settings]({% link _documentation/configurations.md %}).

## Deleting records

You can delete records from the view, by emptying the duration field. The record will be removed after saving the week data.
