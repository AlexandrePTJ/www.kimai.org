A Kimai 2 plugin, which allows to configure additional fields for timesheets, customers, projects and activities.

## Features

Configure additional fields in various formats for the following data types:

- `Timesheets`
- `Customers`
- `Projects`
- `Activities`
- `User`
- `Expenses` - see [Expenses plugin]({% link _store/expenses-bundle.md %})

You can create as many fields as you want for each data type, where each field:

- is either optional or mandatory
- has its own visibility, so the access can be restricted:
    - to certain customer/project/activity combinations (eg. a "location" field will only be shown for customer X and project Y)
    - to users with certain permissions or roles
- can be described with a name and help text
- has a maximum length of 255 character

The custom fields will be shown on the "create and edit entity" forms and can have the following types:

- `string`
- `integer`
- `number`
- `duration`
- `money`
- `language`
- `currency`
- `country`
- `color`
- `date`
- `datetime`
- `email`
- `textarea`
- `invoice template`
- `checkbox` (boolean, use: 1 = checked/true or 0 = unchecked/false)
- `choice-list` (add entries comma separated into default-value field)

The custom-field data is then available in:

- Data-tables will display all visible fields
- Exports (HTML and Spreadsheets include all visible fields)
- Timesheet exports (include visible timesheet fields)
- API (collections and entities)
- Invoice templates (custom templates only)

Be aware:

- Restricted fields won't be visible on the create forms, as Kimai initially can't know if the rule will apply. In these cases the form will only be shown in the edit forms.
- Sensitive data can be configured as "invisible", so it will not show up in the above mentioned places.
- Custom fields for users are not exported via the API (this is a limitation in the core application)

### Compatibility

Please make sure to use the correct version of the plugin, which must be compatible with your Kimai version:

| ---               |---                        |
| 1.10 - 1.11       | 1.9                       |

## Installation

{% include store-plugin-installation.md plugin="MetaFieldsBundle" command="kimai:bundle:metafields:install" %}

## Usage

When logged in as `SUPER_ADMIN`, you should now see the custom-fields administration screen at `/en/expenses/`.

If this was successful, you can now think about giving permissions to other users as well.

### Permissions

This bundle ships a new permission, which limit access to certain functions:

- `configure_meta_fields` - allows to administrate the custom field definitions

By default, it is assigned to each user with the role `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.

{% include alert.html icon="fas fa-exclamation" type="warning" alert="You don't need the following since Kimai 1.6. Please adjust all permission settings in your administration." %}

Read how to assign these permission to your user roles in the [permission documentation](https://www.kimai.org/documentation/permissions.html).

This is a proposal if you use the bundle in a multi-user environment:
```yaml
kimai:
    permissions:
        roles:
            ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: ['configure_meta_fields']
            ROLE_ADMIN: ['configure_meta_fields']
```

After changing the permissions in local.yaml, you need to clear the application cache.
