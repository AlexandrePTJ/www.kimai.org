A Kimai 2 plugin, which allows to use barcodes for `punch-in` and `punch-out` time tracking with Kimai.
You can use it with an attached barcode scanner or you run Kimai on a device (eg. tablet) with a built-in camera.   

If you want to use Kimai in a kiosk mode, where your users should only register their attendance time through  
punch-in and punch-out mode when entering/leaving the building, then this bundle is the solution for you.

It could be as simple as:
- Print the barcodes on your employee cards 
- Mount a tablet to the wall in your entrance room
- Let your users check-in & check-out when entering the building by scanning the barcode from the emplyoee card

You can test it in the ["Plugins" demo](https://www.kimai.org/demo/).

## Features

- Start/Stop work with device camera or a hardware barcode scanner (eg. via USB)
- Upon starting/stopping a record via this plugin, the user will see a short overview screen with the entries of the current week, including some statistics
- The following 1D barcodes are currently supported:
  - `Code 128`
  - `Code 39`
  - `UPC-A` (scanner needs to transmit check digit)
  - `Code 2 of 5`
  - `Code 2 of 5 interleaved`
  - `Codabar` (scanner needs to transmit start & stop digits)
- New user profile screen for the "barcode"
  - Display current barcode (randomly generated if empty)
  - Regenerate random barcode
  - Re-use existing barcode for user
- User specific settings for allowed start and end time (user can only clock in between these times)

You need to configure a non-global activity for starting the record via this plugin. 
This will be used for every recorded timesheet that is created using the kiosk mode.
