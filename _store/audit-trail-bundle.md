The following fields are recorded for changes:
- Timesheet: `begin`, `end`, `duration`, `timezone`, `user`, `activity`, `project`, `description`, `rate`, `fixedRate`, `hourlyRate`, `exported` 
- Activity: `project`, `name`, `comment`, `visible`, `fixedRate`, `hourlyRate`, `color`, `budget`, `timeBudget`

## Installation

{% include store-plugin-installation.md plugin="AuditTrailBundle" command="kimai:bundle:audittrail:install" %}

## Usage

When logged in as `SUPER_ADMIN`, you will now see the overview page at `/en/audit/` and the items audit log screens in the "action" dropdown menus.

If this was successful, you can now think about giving permissions to other users as well.

### Permissions

This bundle ships a couple of new permissions, which limits the access to certain functions:

| Permission Name           | Description |
|---                        |--- |
| `audit_logs`              | see the audit log page with all entries |
| `audit_customer`          | see all changes for the customer objects |
| `audit_project`           |  see all changes for the project objects |
| `audit_activity`          |  see all changes for the activity objects |
| `audit_own_timesheet`     |  see all changes for own timesheet records (only via team timesheets, audit logs are **not** shown in user timesheet panel) |
| `audit_other_timesheet`   |  see all changes in other users timesheet records (only via team timesheets, audit logs are **not** shown in user timesheet panel) |
{: .table }

By default, these are assigned to each user with the role `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN`.
